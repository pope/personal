description             a GTK based Run dialog that closely resembles the \
                        Windows Run dialog
long_description        gRun is a GTK based Run dialog that closely resembles \
                        the Windows Run dialog, just like xexec. It has a \
                        intelligent history mechanism and a dual level fork() \
                        mechanism for launching the application in its own \
                        process. gRun also has support for launching console \
                        mode application in an XTerm as well as associations \
                        for file types.
